# Coinage Scalability and Infrastructure Strategy

## Architecture Overview
- Microservices-based architecture
- Containerized deployment
- Horizontal scaling capabilities

## Infrastructure Components

### 1. Compute Resources
- Kubernetes Cluster
- Auto-scaling worker nodes
- Minimum 3 nodes per environment

#### Node Configuration
- Development: 2 CPU, 8GB RAM
- Staging: 4 CPU, 16GB RAM
- Production: 8 CPU, 32GB RAM

### 2. Database Scaling
- PostgreSQL with read replicas
- Sharding strategy for high-traffic tables
- Connection pooling with PgBouncer

#### Scaling Stages
1. Vertical Scaling (Increase Resources)
2. Read Replica Deployment
3. Horizontal Sharding

### 3. Caching Layer
- Redis Cluster
- Multi-level caching strategy
- Cache invalidation mechanisms

### 4. Message Queue
- Apache Kafka
- Event-driven microservices communication
- Distributed transaction management

## Scaling Strategies

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless service design
- Containerized microservices
- Load balancer with round-robin distribution

### Vertical Scaling
- Incremental resource allocation
- Automatic vertical scaling for critical services
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Service Decomposition

### Microservices
1. User Authentication Service
2. Trading Engine
3. Investment Plan Management
4. Market Data Synchronization
5. Reporting and Analytics
6. Notification Service

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- L1 (In-memory) Caching
- L2 (Distributed) Caching
- Cache-aside pattern
- Time-based and event-based cache invalidation

### Query Optimization
- Database indexing
- Query result caching
- Materialized views
- Batch processing

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Prometheus
- Grafana Dashboards
- Custom metrics tracking

### Logging
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Centralized log aggregation
- Log-based alerting

### Tracing
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- OpenTelemetry integration

## Deployment Pipeline

### Continuous Integration/Deployment
- GitHub Actions
- Automated testing
- Canary deployments
- Blue-Green deployments

## Cost Optimization
- Spot instances for non-critical workloads
- Reserved instances for baseline infrastructure
- Automatic resource rightsizing

## Security Considerations
- Network segmentation
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Regular security audits
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## Estimated Infrastructure Costs
- Development: $500/month
- Staging: $1,500/month
- Production: $5,000-$10,000/month

## Recommended Cloud Providers
1. AWS (Recommended)
2. Google Cloud Platform
3. Microsoft Azure

## Scaling Milestones
1. 1,000 Concurrent Users
2. 10,000 Concurrent Users
3. 100,000 Concurrent Users
